title:  "A Signal run a day keeps the un-link away"

I have a couple of people who are best reachable on the [Signal messaging
app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(software)), but not that many. This
exposes me to an awkward edge case of Signal’s design decisions: Whenever I get
a message (on my phone), I want to reply to it (on my laptop) only to discover
that Signal has un-linked my laptop because of inactivity and won’t sync the
message history from my phone to my laptop, making it impossible to quote-reply
to messages.

After complaining about this on Social Media for the n-th time, I figured I’d
write a quick program to run Signal once a day, so that it won’t un-link my
devices because of too long a period of inactivity. (Of course, the easiest
solution would be to just run Signal in the background all the time. But I don’t
use Signal often enough to justify letting it drain my battery and mobile data.)

In this article, I want to share the program in case it’s useful to anyone else,
and also explain how to install it on a Mac, as this kind of “do a task once a
day” automation is a useful pattern.

![](2024-09-18-signal-screenshot-featured.jpg)

## High-level sketch

1. Run Signal for, say, 5 minutes.
1. Ensure at-most-once semantics regardless of the task scheduler. For example,
   if I wanted to start this program from an `@reboot` hook and restart my
   computer a few times, I don’t want the program to do anything after the first
   run of the day. (Similarly, an on-online hook of NetworkManager or similar
   software might fire once per network interface, or something like that.)
1. Depending on the specifics of the activation mechanism, the computer might be
   online or not. The program should wait for a little while, say, 10 minutes,
   until internet connectivity was established.
1. I would like to log the program’s output (and Signal’s output) for debugging.

## Checking connectivity

The easiest option is to just… not do a connectivity check at all, and hope for
the best. This would probably work well enough in practice, but I would like the
debug logs to have a high signal-to-noise ratio: If I have to debug why Signal
was unlinked despite my automation attempts, I don’t want to comb through tons
of spurious log messages that were a result from being offline. So, I want to
check that I’m online before even starting Signal.

The most thorough option would be to somehow ask Signal programmatically whether
it can connect to its servers and then wait until it can. I don’t think Signal
has such an interface, so we’ll chose a middle-ground solution and work with a
stand-in.

Using HTTP for connectivity checks is an easy way in today’s world. We just need
a target website that doesn’t go offline unless I want it to. So let’s just use
this website! Go’s `net/http` package that is included in Go’s standard library
makes this super easy:

```go
func checkConnectivity() error {
	_, err := http.Get("https://michael.stapelberg.ch/")
	return err
}
```

Now we just need to loop around this single connectivity check:

```go
func waitForConnectivity(timeout time.Duration) error {
	const freq = 1 * time.Second
	for start := time.Now(); time.Since(start) < timeout; time.Sleep(freq) {
		if err := checkConnectivity(); err != nil {
			log.Printf("connectivity check failed: %v", err)
			continue
		}
		return nil // connectivity check succeeded
	}
	return fmt.Errorf("no connectivity established within %v", timeout)
}
```

We could improve this code to be more generally applicable by adding
[Exponential Backoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff), but
for this particular connectivity check, we should be fine even without
Exponential Backoff.

## Ensuring at-most-once semantics

An easy way to implement at-most-once semantics is to delegate to the file
system: we can specify the `O_EXCL` flag when creating our program’s log file to
make the first creation attempt proceed, but any further creation attempt fail
because the file already exists. We’ll then redirect the standard library’s
`log` package output to the log file:

```go
logFn := filepath.Join(home, "signal-keepalive", "_logs", time.Now().Format("2006-01-02")+".txt")
f, err := os.OpenFile(logFn, os.O_RDWR|os.O_CREATE|os.O_EXCL, 0666)
if err != nil {
	if os.IsExist(err) {
		return nil // nothing to do, already ran today
	}
	return err
}
// Intentionally not closing this file so that even the log.Fatal()
// call in the calling function will end up in the log file.

log.SetOutput(f) // redirect standard library logging into this file
log.Printf("signal-keepalive, waiting for internet connectivity")
```

Not closing the file might seem weird at first, but remember that this is a
short-lived program and the operating system closes all file handles of a
process when it exits.

## Full program code

For your convenience, here is the full program code. It contains a bunch of file
system paths that you might want or need to adjust.

package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"net/http"

func checkConnectivity() error {
	_, err := http.Get("https://michael.stapelberg.ch/")
	return err
}

func waitForConnectivity(timeout time.Duration) error {
	for start := time.Now(); time.Since(start) < timeout; time.Sleep(1 * time.Second) {
		if err := checkConnectivity(); err != nil {
			log.Printf("connectivity check failed: %v", err)

	}
	return fmt.Errorf("no connectivity established within %v", timeout)
}

func keepalive() error {
	// Limit to one attempt per day by exclusively creating a logfile.

	}
	logFn := filepath.Join(home, "signal-keepalive", "_logs", time.Now().Format("2006-01-02")+".txt")

	log.SetOutput(f) // redirect standard library logging into this file
	log.Printf("signal-keepalive, waiting for internet connectivity")

	// Wait for network connectivity
	if err := waitForConnectivity(10 * time.Minute); err != nil {

	signal := exec.Command("/Applications/Signal.app/Contents/MacOS/Signal", "--start-in-tray")
	signal.Stdout = f
	signal.Stderr = f

	// Wait for some time to give Signal a chance to synchronize messages.
	const signalWaitTime = 5 * time.Minute
	log.Printf("giving signal %v to sync messages", signalWaitTime)
	time.Sleep(signalWaitTime)

	// Stop signal

		return err
	}
	log.Printf("waiting for signal")
	log.Printf("signal returned: %v", signal.Wait())
	log.Printf("all done")

	return f.Sync()
}

func main() {
	if err := keepalive(); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}
```

## macOS installation: launchd

The corresponding piece of infrastructure to
[systemd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd) on Linux is called
[launchd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launchd) on macOS. Aside from managing
daemon processes, launchd also supports time-triggered program execution,
specifically via the `StartCalendarInterval` configuration option.

I followed [Alvin Alexander’s blog post about launchd StartCalendarInterval
examples](https://alvinalexander.com/mac-os-x/launchd-plist-examples-startinterval-startcalendarinterval/)
and decided to configure my program to run at 08:03 each day:

<details>

<summary>
Click to expand: <code>net.zekjur.signalkeepalive.plist</code>
</summary>

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN"
"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>StartCalendarInterval</key>
    <dict>
      <key>Hour</key>
      <integer>8</integer>
      <key>Minute</key>
      <integer>3</integer>
    </dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>net.zekjur.signalkeepalive</string>
    <key>Program</key>
    <string>/Users/michael/signal-keepalive/signalkeepalive</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

</details>

What happens when my computer isn’t running at 08:03, for example because the
lid is closed? Apple documents the behavior in the [`launchd.plist(5)` man
page](https://keith.github.io/xcode-man-pages/launchd.plist.5.html):

> *Unlike cron which skips job invocations when the computer is asleep, launchd
> will start the job the next time the computer wakes up.*

To install and test this configuration:

1. Copy the plist file to `~/Library/LaunchAgents`
1. Run `launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/net.zekjur.signalkeepalive.plist`
1. Run `launchctl start net.zekjur.signalkeepalive`

## In practice

It’s interesting to see this behavior in practice. Take note of the time stamps
in the following log. The computer was not running at 08:03. At 08:18, it woke
up to update background information (Apple calls this [“Power
Nap”](https://support.apple.com/en-az/guide/mac-help/mh40773/mac)), and then it
suspended again (while Signal was running) until it woke up at 08:47 again:

```
2024/09/07 08:18:10 signal-keepalive, waiting for internet connectivity
2024/09/07 08:18:11 connectivity verified, starting signal

2024/09/07 08:47:31 signal returned: signal: killed
2024/09/07 08:47:31 all done
```

## Linux installation: systemd

With systemd, we need two units. First, a `signal-keepalive.service` unit to
declare which program should be run:

```
cat > ~/.config/systemd/user/signal-keepalive.service <<'EOT'
[Unit]
Description=signal keepalive
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/home/michael/signal-keepalive/signalkeepalive

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
EOT
```

And secondly, a `signal-keepalive.timer` unit which automatically starts the
`signal-keepalive.service` every day:

```
cat > ~/.config/systemd/user/signal-keepalive.timer <<'EOT'
[Unit]
Description=signal keepalive

[Timer]
Persistent=true
OnCalendar=daily

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
EOT
```

The `Persistent=true` line is important so that the program will be run even
when the computer is asleep when the timer would have fired.

Let’s enable the timer:

```
systemctl --user enable --now signal-keepalive.timer
```


For an initial test run, we can start the .service directly:

```
systemctl --user restart signal-keepalive.service
```

## Conclusion

It’s silly that I need to go through so much trouble just because I don’t use
Signal enough.

I also don’t understand why Signal can’t just sync message history from my phone
to my computer when linking. WhatsApp and Telegram have no trouble doing it.

Either way, I thought this was a fun little refresher on automating periodic
jobs.
