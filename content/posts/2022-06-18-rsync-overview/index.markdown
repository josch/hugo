For many years, I was only a casual user of
[rsync](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync) and used it mostly for one-off file
transfers.

Over time, I found rsync useful in more and more cases, and would recommend
every computer user put this great tool into their toolbox ðŸ›  ðŸ§° !

Iâ€™m publishing a series of blog posts about rsync:

* [rsync, article 1: Scenarios](../2022-06-18-rsync-article-1-scenarios/). To
  motivate why it makes sense to look at rsync, I present three scenarios for
  which I have come to appreciate rsync: DokuWiki transfers, Software deployment
  and Backups.
* [rsync, article 2: Surroundings](../2022-07-02-rsync-surroundings/). Now that
  we know what to use rsync for, how can we best integrate rsync into monitoring
  and alerting, and on which operating systems does it work?
* [rsync, article 3: How does rsync
  work?](../2022-07-02-rsync-how-does-it-work). With rsync up and running, itâ€™s
  time to take a peek under the hood of rsync to better understand how it works.
* rsync, article 4: My own rsync implementation (To be published.)
