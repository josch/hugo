[gokrazy](https://gokrazy.org/) is an appliance platform for Go programs: with
just a few commands, you can deploy your Go program(s) on a Raspberry Pi or a
(typically small) PC.

I‚Äôm excited to let you know that gokrazy now comes with a re-designed `gok`
command line tool and gokrazy instance configuration mechanism!

## Context: gokrazy in a few words

<img src="gokrazy-logo.png" align="right" width="200" style="margin-left: 1.5em" alt="gokrazy logo">

The traditional way to run Go software on a Raspberry Pi would be to install
Raspbian or some other Linux distribution onto the SD card, copy over your
program(s) and then maintain that installation (do regular updates).

I thought it would be nicer to run my Raspberry Pis such that **only Go
software** is run by the Linux kernel on it, without any traditional Linux
distribution programs like package managers or even the usual [GNU Core
Utilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Core_Utilities).

gokrazy builds Go programs into a read-only SquashFS root file system
image. When that image is started on a Raspberry Pi, a minimal init system
supervises the Go programs, and a DHCP and NTP client configure the IP address
and synchronize the time, respectively. After the first installation, all
subsequent updates can be done over the network, with an A/B partitioning
scheme.

I use gokrazy to, for example:

* [Scan incoming paper mail into PDF files on Google
  Drive](https://github.com/stapelberg/scan2drive).

* Connect to the internet using [router7, my small home internet
router](https://router7.org/) written in Go, running on a [fast router PC
build](/posts/2021-07-10-linux-25gbit-internet-router-pc-build/) that handles a
[25 Gbit/s Fiber To The Home
connection](/posts/2022-04-23-fiber7-25gbit-upgrade/).

* [Automate the lights in my home](/posts/2021-01-10-mqtt-introduction/), and
  [control and monitor the heating](https://github.com/stapelberg/hmgo).

* Offer [Tailscale access](https://gokrazy.org/packages/tailscale/) to a
  Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W in my home network to then send Wake On Lan (WOL)
  packets before SSH'ing into my normally-suspended computers. See also my post
  [DIY out-of-band management: remote console server
  (2022)](/posts/2022-08-27-out-of-band-remote-console/).

## Before and after

Previously, the concept of gokrazy instance configuration was only a
convention. Each gokrazy build was created using the `gokr-packer` CLI tool, and
configured by the packer‚Äôs command-line flags, parameters, config files in
`~/.config` and per-package config files in the current directory
(e.g. `flags/github.com/gokrazy/breakglass/flags.txt`).

Now, all gokrazy commands and tools understand the `--instance` flag (or `-i`
for short), which determines the directory from which the [Instance
Config](https://gokrazy.org/userguide/instance-config/) is read. For a gokrazy
instance named ‚Äúhello‚Äù, the default directory is `~/gokrazy/hello`, which
contains the `config.json` file.

## Example: creating an instance for a Go working copy

Let‚Äôs say I have [the evcc repository](https://github.com/evcc-io/evcc) cloned
as `~/src/evcc`. evcc is an electric vehicle charge controller with PV
integration, written in Go.

Now I want to run `evcc` on my Raspberry Pi using gokrazy. First, I create a new
instance:

```bash
% gok -i evcc new
gokrazy instance configuration created in /home/michael/gokrazy/evcc/config.json
(Use 'gok -i evcc edit' to edit the configuration interactively.)

Use 'gok -i evcc add' to add packages to this instance

To deploy this gokrazy instance, see 'gok help overwrite'
```

Now let‚Äôs add our working copy of `evcc` to the instance:

```bash
% gok -i evcc add .
2023/01/15 18:55:39 Adding the following package to gokrazy instance "evcc":
  Go package  : github.com/evcc-io/evcc
  in Go module: github.com/evcc-io/evcc
  in local dir: /tmp/evcc
2023/01/15 18:55:39 Creating gokrazy builddir for package github.com/evcc-io/evcc
2023/01/15 18:55:39 Creating go.mod with replace directive
go: creating new go.mod: module gokrazy/build/github.com/evcc-io/evcc
2023/01/15 18:55:39 Adding package to gokrazy config
2023/01/15 18:55:39 All done! Next, use 'gok overwrite' (first deployment), 'gok update' (following deployments) or 'gok run' (run on running instance temporarily)
```

We might want to monitor this Raspberry Pi‚Äôs stats later, so let‚Äôs add the
Prometheus node exporter to our gokrazy instance, too:

```bash
% gok -i evcc add github.com/prometheus/node_exporter
2023/01/15 19:04:05 Adding github.com/prometheus/node_exporter as a (non-local) package to gokrazy instance evcc
2023/01/15 19:04:05 Creating gokrazy builddir for package github.com/prometheus/node_exporter
2023/01/15 19:04:05 Creating go.mod before calling go get
go: creating new go.mod: module gokrazy/build/github.com/prometheus/node_exporter
2023/01/15 19:04:05 running [go get github.com/prometheus/node_exporter@latest]
go: downloading github.com/prometheus/node_exporter v1.5.0
[‚Ä¶]
2023/01/15 19:04:07 Adding package to gokrazy config
```

It‚Äôs time to insert an SD card (`/dev/sdx`), which we will overwrite with a
gokrazy build:

```bash
% gok -i evcc overwrite --full /dev/sdx
```

See [gokrazy quickstart](https://gokrazy.org/quickstart/) for more detailed instructions.

## Automation

The new `gok` subcommands (`add`, `update`, etc.) are much easier to manage than
long `gokr-packer` command lines.

The new [Automation page](https://gokrazy.org/userguide/automation/) shows how
to automate common tasks, be it daily updates via `cron`, or automated building
in Continuous Integration environments like GitHub Actions.

## Migration

Are you already a gokrazy user? If so, see [the Instance Config Migration
Guide](https://gokrazy.org/userguide/migration-guide/) for how to switch from
the old `gokr-packer` tool to the new `gok` command.
